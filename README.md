# A Very Madrigal React Hook Workshop!

In this workshop, within the context of Disney's *Encanto*, we'll explore [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s functional component hooks, including [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html), [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext), and [useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref). Gaining understanding and eventual mastery of these techniques will help you to maximize your React capabilities. Using these hooks makes functional components (our previously so-called "dumb" components) very powerful!

## Getting started for the workshop

1. **Fork and clone this repo** - You're very used to this step by now. Nothing new here.
3. **npm install** - Again, nothing new here. This will get everything set up on your computer, ready to go to follow along with the workshop.
4. **npm start** - No need for the word "run". The "npm start" command will get the app started and automatically open localhost in your browser, aimed at the correct port. The browser will also automatically update to reflect changes you make in the code. No refresh required.
5. **Don't talk about Bruno!** - Do you understand?!
6. **That's it!** - Now you're ready to follow along with the workshop.

## Repository contents

This workshop was bootstrapped using the extremely useful "[npx create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)" terminal command. As such, there is a lot within this repo that we will not be using directly, but comes packaged with the library. Feel free to explore the contents of this repo, but for our purposes, we'll mostly be sticking to *App.js* within the *src* folder of the root directory. For more information about everything involved with the installation of *create-react-app*, check out the *[Create-React-App.README.md](https://github.com/7thPorter/react-hook-workshop/blob/main/Create-React-App.README.md)* file in this repo. As always, the [official documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a great place to start for more learning.
